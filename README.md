# Exploit-for-filesharing-DOS

This technique is effective against Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and 3 (English). To improve reliability and performance, I have implemented several strategies:

Jumping to a static 'call esp'
Performing a backward jump to code at a known offset from the stack pointer
The FTP server does not properly manage the amount of data or the number of bytes in the password entered by the user. When a long password or an excessive number of characters is used during authentication, the server crashes upon receiving and processing the input, resulting in a denial of service.

Exploiting these issues successfully allows remote attackers to crash the server, thereby denying service to legitimate users.
